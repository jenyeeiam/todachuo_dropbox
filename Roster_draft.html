		My name is Ozawa, but you can call me Kana, or Gori.  I made up my own nicknames but no one actually calls me by them. I'm an assistant captain, but you wouldn't know it because the assistant captain doesn't do anything!  But it's nice to be honored regardless.  You'll notice me at practice because I don't stop moving, EVER!  I love to practice.

		My name is Akine.  I'm an infielder, but when You had a mental breakdown at practice one day Yamasaki-san thought I would be a good catcher.  Catching is hard stuff.  I don't speak very good english, but I'm trying my best to learn.  I am one third of the tripod that is Imari, Toufuku and myself.  A deadly combination indeed.

		My name is Imari, but you can call me Emily.  My favorite thing to do at softball is cheer for my teammates.  I'm the best cheerer, and the team loves it when I yell YA-TA and go around and give high fives!  I'm the second leg of the tripod and the shortest member.

I even broke my hand last year from swinging too much!  Unfortunately i broke my hand after Jen and Ohta's hands were healed, so I did not become a Hand Friend.

I'm from West Virginia, and my claim to fame is winning the "Little Miss West Virginia" beauty pagent.  My hometown has no electricity so I'm excited to use my first telephone and ride my first bullet train.

		I'm the CEO of this company bitches!  I live in in the penthouse suite of the hospital, and I can direct my nurses around to do my biddings.  I'm from Hokkaido, and it's the best place in the world, even better than Disney Sea!  I want to go back so badly, but this company is holding me back.  For now, I will plot my escape...

		Note:  This crocodile has yet to be seen by human eyes.

I support the Toda rugby team and go to all their events.  I speak the best english in the company because I've traveled all around the world, even to Vancouver!

		My name is Murata-sensei and I am the BIGGEST Todachuo softball fan there is.  I am at every game, and I often stop by at practice.  I'd really like to be coach if I could, as I think I'm very insightful about softball and life in general.  My biggest claim to fame is my epic post game speeches.  I've been clocked in at a full 20 minutes!  Don't even try to stop me!

		My name is Suzuki-san but you can call me "Lucky Position."  I am in charge of all softball operations for the team.  Usually I just take care of the logistical side, but I've really gotten involved in coaching lately.  You can think of me as the general manager of the team.  I always stand at the end of the dugout because I can yell at Yamasaki-san, while staying dry from the rain!

		You can call me "The Sushi Guy" because I love the stuff!  Whenever we have a special guest in town I suggest we go out for sushi!  I also bring candy and popsicles to practice sometimes. The team really likes those days because they get a break from practice to eat the popsicles.  I really spoil them, so I think I'm their favorite.

		My name is Yamasaki-san, but you can call me "Motorcycle."  I'm the head coach of the team and get to wear number 30.  I was a catcher for the Japanese national team, so I know a lot about softball.  I'm such a nice guy though, so I get the staff around me make all the decisions at game time.  My favorite thing to do at practice is hit knock, and talk on the phone.

		My name is Hattori-san, but you can call me "Coach."  Last year I was one of two athletic trainers, but this year I've been promoted to the primary trainer and assistant coach.  I run the practices and decide what drills the team does.  I get new ideas for drills all the time, and the best part of my day is watching the team do them improperly!

		My name is Hoshino-san, and I'm the bus driver.  You might not think that my job is very important but it is.  Todachuo uses the bus everyday for practice, and we drive to all of our games.  So when we have a weekend series in Nagasaki, I'm your guy!  Some of these trips require more than 12 hours of driving, so in this case I need another driver to take shifts.  It also helps to have someone to help me clean the bus, as it normally takes me two hours by myself!
