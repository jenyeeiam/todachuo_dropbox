What is it about this country that makes me so nervous?  What is it about being so afraid to fail here?  It's like I'm 16 again!  What the fuck??  So fucking nervous and anxious and uneasy about what?  NOTHING.  These people are babies to you and they're no where near as skilled or trained.  Why can't I convince myself I'm better than everyone else here?  Like is it that different?  Why can't I convince myself that this shit bottom of the barrel of the team is beneath me?  I can't for the life of me trick myself of thinking that for some reason.  Fuck it's just another practice get over it.  What else is there to think about though?  I guess there isn't.  At least under normal circumstances I'd have more than one focus in life, aside from social things.  School + softball.  Work + softball + coaching i guess.  I don't know if I'll ever figure it out.  But it's fucking ridiculous.  FIGURE IT OUT.
