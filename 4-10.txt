This country is a weird and fantastical one.  THE hardest part about living here is adjusting to cultural differences in everyday life, which in my case is the softball field.  This country is the most work happy place I've ever been to.  You think you're a workaholic?  Don't even try.  A Japanese worker has you beat by mile.  There is no such thing as 9-5, it's 7-9 or whenever the job is done.  And even after you clock out of the office, there is dinner and drinks with your boss to be had.  There is no family time, there is only work time.  There is no chivalry, no ladies first, age is everything.  If you're old you sit back put your feet up, if you're young you do all the work. This is a patriarchal society and women are meant to get married, stay at home and take care of the kids.  

This work all the time mentality translates into softball via PRACTICE.  Practices in North America last maybe 3 hours, practices here can literally be 8-5.  What can you do in all that time?  I'm not sure, I'm delerious after the first 4 hours so I can't remember!  We have a double header today?  Piece of cake.  Let's practice for 2 more hours afterwards!  Lunch is just an uneccessary time in the day that involves not working, so it's easier to just skip it.  Hungry is just a state of mind after all.  I can only guess that the motivation behind all the practice is in preparation for the 22 league games that are played from April to October.  To me this is just a game, but to everyone else around me this is the Olympics, the World Series, THE most important time of the year.  Therefore, the team that practices the most wins in the end?  I don't believe that to be true, and neither do the standings, but I suppose tunnel vision can be a powerful thing.  

  

and in training for the Olympics I trained 6 days a week as well.
