		My name is You, pronounced "Yo." My favorite sushi is uni, and my favorite noodle is soba.  As the starting catcher it is my job to take care of the emotional pitchers we have, especially the ones that don't speak Japanese!  It's a pretty exhausting job, and I wish someone would consider my feelings too...

I was the "Homerun Queen" last year so basically I run this ship.  Another talent of mine is singing and dancing, and my favorite songs are "Candy Smile" and "Peanut Butter Jelly Time."

		My name is Akine.  I'm an infielder but one day Yamasaki-san thought I would be a good catcher.  Catching sure is hard stuff, so I have since retired from the position.  I don't speak very good English, but I'm trying my best to learn.  I am one third of the tripod that is Imari, Toufuku and myself.  A deadly combination indeed.

		My name is Imari, but you can call me Emily.  My favorite thing to do at softball is cheer for my teammates.  I'm the best cheerer, and the team loves it when I yell YA-TA and go around and give high fives!  I'm the second leg of the tripod and the shortest member.

I even broke my hand last year from swinging too much!  Unfortunately I broke my hand after Jen and Ohta's hands were healed, so I did not become a Hand Friend.

I'm from West Virginia, and my claim to fame is winning the "Little Miss West Virginia" beauty pagent.  My hometown has no electricity so I'm excited to use my first telephone and ride my first bullet train.

I'm a 2B/SS and my signature move is what I like to call a "Japanese Bend and Snap."  It's a little bend at the knees and jump, and I need to do it before I field a ground ball or before I step into the box.  I'm very superstitious.

I'd really like to be coach if I could, as I think I'm very insightful about softball and life in general.  My biggest claim to fame is my epic post game speeches.

Usually I just take care of the logistical side, but I've really gotten involved in coaching lately.  You can think of me as the general manager of the team.  I always stand at the end of the dugout because I can yell at Yamasaki-san, while staying dry from the rain!

The team really likes those days because they get a break from practice to eat the popsicles.  I really spoil them, so I think I'm their favorite.

I was a catcher for the Japanese national team, so I know a lot about softball.  I'm such a nice guy though, so I get the staff around me make all the decisions at game time.  My favorite thing to do at practice is hit knock, and talk on the phone.

I run the practices and decide what drills the team does.  I get new ideas for drills all the time, and the best part of my day is watching the team do them improperly!

So when we have a weekend series in Nagasaki, I'm your guy!  Some of these trips require more than 12 hours of driving, so in this case I need another driver to take shifts.  It also helps to have someone to help me clean the bus, as it normally takes me two hours by myself!

<p class = "intro">Japanese is a hard language to learn.  Let's all learn together!  Here are some words, phrases and tips vital to survival on a Japanese softball team.</p>  


<ol style = "font-family: Bookman, serif; font-size: 1.1em">
	<li>Counting to 10.  Probably <strong>THE</strong> most important thing to know playing softball.  The Japanese love counting reps and timing drills! </li>
		<ul>
		<li>1 - ichi, 2 - ni, 3 - san, 4 - shi, 5 - go, 6 - roku, 7 - shichi, 8 - hachi, 9 - kyu, 10 - ju, 11 - ju ichi, 12 - ju ni etc etc</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Many Japanese words originate from English.  Sound more Japanese by saying words twice!  For example,</li>
		<ul>
		<li>yes yes</li>
		<li>no no</li>
		<li>many many</li>
		<li>ok ok</li>
		</ul>

	<li>Asking questions - The 5 W's.</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Who? - Dare?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Who is the head coach? = Kantoku wa <em>dare</em> desu ka?
			</ul>
		<li>What? - Nani/Nan?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>What is that?  <em>Nan</em> desu ka?
			</ul>
		<li>When? - Itsu?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>When do you go?  <em>Itsu</em> ikimasu ka?
			</ul>
		<li>Where? - Doko?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Where is my riceball?  Watashi no onigiri wa <em>doko</em> desu ka?
			</ul>
		<li>Why? - Naze?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Why running?  <em>Naze</em> ranningu?
			</ul>	
		</ul>
	<li>Daijobu desu = I'm ok.  Very useful phrase to get out of extra practice, running, or even strange foods!</li>
	<li>Complements are easy because any good deed or job well done can be acknowledged with "Nice."  For example, "Nice batting," "Nice pitching," "Nice eating," "Nice English."</li>

	
</ol>


<p class = "intro">Now for some vocabulary.  Probably the hardest part about communicating in Japan is the inability to come up with the words to express what you want or are looking for.  Hover the curser over the picture to learn the words.  All Japanese words are written in Romaji, or the "English" form of the word.  Here are some rules of thumb for pronounciation.</p>

<div id = "pronounciation">
<ul style = "font-family: Bookman, serif; font-size: 1.1em">
<li>Vowel sounds
	<ul>
	<li>A = ah, as in hah or law </li>
	<li>I = ee, as in free or machine  </li>
	<li>U = oo, as in boo or moo  </li>
	<li>E = eh, as in met </li>
	<li>O = oh, as in so or mow </li>
	</ul>
<li>There are no L or V sounds, where L sounds like R, and V sounds like B. </li>
<li>R sounds like a mix between R and L, and sort of like D.  R in Japanese sounds similar to R in Spanish</li>
<li>Double consonants means you pronounce it twice.  Ex. Bookkepper. </li> 
</ul>

<p>Living in Japan has its challenges, most notably the language and culture.  There are some things that you do in North America and just don't do in Japan and vice versa.  I think I've gotten the hang of most things, but sometimes I'll admit I play the dumb foreigner card.  Don't tell anyone.  I also live a somewhat sheltered life with Todachu, so my perspective of Japan may be slightly skewed from the Japan that "Regular Jane" sees in a normal day.  But regardless, Japan is a weird and wonderful place and some things we do here are pretty smart.  Please enjoy this list of Japanese customs that I've compiled that would be nice to adopt in North America.  </p>

<ol style = "width:85%; margin:auto">
	<li>Universal greetings - Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.  My teammates say hello to everyone, even when they have no idea who this new person is!  I suppose it could be a way to make new friends? </li>
	<li>Eliminating trash cans and forcing people to hold on to their garbage.  I'm guilty of complaining about it sometimes, but you can't argue with how clean this country is.  I believe that most people don't want to litter...unless they have no soul.</li>
	<li>Ping pong at restaurants.  Not ping pong the sport (actually named table tennis), but a doorbell type ringer at your table.  Ring it for service!</li>
	<li>Not being wasteful.  Maybe it's just a softball thing but we count the balls every day, and if one is missing then we better find it because that's 6 dollars.  I will forever be conscious of the foul balls that disappear into the bushes.</li>
	<li>Segregated recycling.  Self explanatory.  I'm looking at you America.</li>
	<li>Well behaved children.  For the most part, you don't see kids running amuck and throwing tantrums.  I believe parents beat their kids here.  Just making an assumption.</li>
	<li>Absence of tipping.  Who knows what the conventional tipping percentage is anyways?  The paycheck of the 16 year old at the steaky gusto shouldn't be a subjective thing. Increase the price of everything and call it a day.</li>
	<li>Absence of picky eaters.  Again, maybe a Toda thing but I have teammates who don't like fish.  Is this real life?  But by golly they'll eat it anyways!  They finish every last bite and they'll say it's delicious afterwards too.  Refer to number 6.</li>
	<li>Taking your shoes off before entering the house.  I always thought it was weird how people left their shoes on anyways.</li>
	<li>Safety.  In 2013 the crime rate in Japan has fallen for the 11th straight year, and is regarded as the safest country in the world according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Handguns are forbidden to the public and seeing kids by themselves on the trains and in public is common.  Good job Japanese government.</li>

<p style ="font-size:0.9em; font-style:italic">Disclaimer: Responses may or may not be accurately translated (or accurate).</p>

<p>H: Hi my name is Honma and I'm a new member to Todachuo.  Not trying to brag, but Jen says I'm her favorite new baby.  In your face everyone else!</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Honma, as a new player what do you like best about playing for Toda?</span><br>
H: Well to be honest with you, I'm in it for the money.  I may be only 18 but my 10 year plan is to run this hospital.  Watch out for Honma!
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: When I first met you, I thought you were kindof shy, but I come to find out you're really weird and I love it!  Tell me about your pregame rituals.</span><br>
H: Well as you know, I'm pretty superstitious.  On game days I wake up and make my bed.  Then, I take a shower to think about the day ahead of me. Basically I give myself a peptalk in the shower.  Life isn't easy as a baby, but if I can get past these first few years then I can start taking over this show.  
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: What's your favorite food?</span><br>
H: I have very mature tastebuds for my age.  My favorite foods are horse liver sashimi and sea cucumber.  I keep some sea cucumber jerky in my fanny for whenever I have a craving.
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: If you were an animal, which animal would you be?</span><br>
H: My family used to have a great pyrenees named Leo, so I'd want to be a great pyrenees too.  They say that dogs look like their owners and I believe that holds true in this case.

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Who's your favorite Disney princess?</span><br>
H: Definitely Jasmine from Aladdin because I feel like I can relate to her story.  I often feel like I'm trapped and not living up to my full potential of taking over the world.  But, I am learning to be patient and I know that day will come...soon.  
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Do you have a favorite TV show?</span><br>
H: Ain't nobody got time for that!  I barely have enough time to sleep.  Besides TV is for unproductive people, not for go-getters like me.  I do listen to K-Pop on the bus though because it helps me think.  One day I'd like to renew my passport and travel to North Korea to hang out with Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong Un.

<p style ="font-size:0.9em; font-style:italic">Disclaimer: Responses may or may not be accurately translated (or accurate).</p>

<p>T: Hi my name is Toufuku, but you can call me Tofu.  I'm a third year player for Toda and a baserunning specialist.</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Tofu, you're known as a prankster and a master of Japanese jokes.  Where do you get your ideas from?</span><br>
T: I get my inspiration from Watanabe, we've become good friends and catchball partners.  I've noticed that Jen and Ondee really like taking pictures of Mt. Fuji, so I like to tell them that I see it at practice when it's not there at all!  Japanese joke.  Made you look!  
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: You play with a lot of energy out there.  What do you love most about softball?</span><br>
T: Well I love running first off.  I can beat anyone in a race!  But, I also love being able to compete with my teammates.  We practice a lot and it's the best feeling when we can see our hard work pay off and come out with a win. 
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Who's your favorite team to play in the league?</span><br>
T: That's a tough one, I like playing all the teams.  Especially because we only play each other twice during the regular season, every game is so much fun.  However, if I had to pick I'd say Toyota because they're one of the strongest teams with good batting and pitching.  I wish I were as tall as Abbott sometimes.  
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: If you were an animal, which animal would you be?</span><br>
T: I'm a dog person for sure so I'd want to be a dog, specifically a toy poodle.  I think they're just so proper and sophisticated.  
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: What's your favorite food?  Do you cook?</span><br>
T: I'm a chocoholic, I could eat it everyday if I could!  And no I don't cook at home, but I'm a meat eater so I like going out to yaki niku restaurants. 
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Do you have a favorite manga series?</span><br>
T: Akine's the manga girl, I'm not much of a reader.  I like pictures though, and I enjoy flipping through fashion magazines.  I consider myself very fashion forward.  
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Do you like Japanese or English movies?</span><br>
T: I like both, but my favorite movie of all time is Harry Potter.  I like all the movies but my favorite will always be the first one.  Harry was so cute when he was younger!   
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Anything the Americans do to get on your nerves?</span><br>
T: Well I probably shouldn't say this, but I wish I didn't have to go to Hamanasu either!     
</p>

<p><span style = "color:#000099; font-style:italic">J: Last question.  I hear you're a closet karaoke star.  What's your favorite song to sing?</span><br>
T: The E-girls are my favorite.  I sing all of their songs, and I think I'm their biggest fan.  Let's sing along to this one!

<p><em>The Eternal Struggle With Food in Japan</em></p>

<p>There are two basic Japanese food genres, rice and noodles.  Period.  Japan isn't exactly a big country with lots of land for agriculture so much of the food is imported in.  And being an island, the cost to import goods becomes expensive.  Therefore, any sort of meat or vegetable serves as a condiment to the aformentioned rice or noodles.  Case 1 - Bento boxes.  Look at the ratio of rice to other stuff!</p>  

<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/5JHAVs4.jpg?1" style= "width:40%; display:block"/>
</center>

<p>Case 2 - Ramen.  One skinny slice of pork, a few bamboo shoots/beansprouts and some canned corn.  Destination hungry :(. </p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gJXdVcw.jpg" style= "width:40%; display:block"/>
</center>

<p>Then there's the Japanese invention of hamburg.  Which is a beef (we think) patty usually served with a couple potato wedges and no bun because that would be a hamburger...Duh.  </p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xXK45w6.png" style= "width:40%; display:block"/>
</center>

<p>For one that doesn't really care for burgers in the first place, I try to avoid all forms of hamburg(er).  However, sometimes they do find their way into the bento boxes.  A sneaky trick indeed.  </p>

<p>In North America, it's usually the opposite arrangement where the meat or vegetable is the main part of the meal and the starch is the side. Not to mention there are more starch options to choose from such as potatoes, various grains, or bread.  There is also a huge range of diets that has become almost obnoxious, from gluten free, paleo, vegetarian, no sugar/starch, Adkins, Weight Watchers, vegan, South Beach, North Beach, Beach Body, and the list goes on.  The menu at TGI Fridays has become an encyclopedia it's so big with calorie counts and "skinny" sections that are surely meant to cause shame and late night ice cream runs.  However, living in Japan has made me want all those choices more than anything! </p>

<p>According to the International Organization for Migration, the net migration rate or the difference between the number of people entering and the number of people leaving Japan is a measly 0.4 per 1000 people over the last 4 years.  Compared to Canada where the net migration rate is 6 per 1000 people over the same time period.  Therefore, one does not see very many ethnic minorities in Japan walking around who aren't tourists.  There isn't the little Vietnamese lady on the corner making bowls of pho and bahn mi every day, or the hole in the wall taco shop where you have to order in Spanish.  Tokyo being a big city obviously has more choices, but even in the Mexican places you'd be hard pressed to see a real Mexican behind the counter.  But again, with the expensive nature of importing goods it's difficult to create ethnic food that actually tastes right in the first place.</p>

<p>It's not that Japanese food tastes bad, it's that most of it tastes the same.  There is a lot of mayonnaise, sweet soy based sauces, bowls of noodles, and deep fried everything.  Basically it took me about three months to try everything Japanese, and I'm pretty sure the sukiyaki, yakisoba and okonomiyaki are all made of the same thing in different forms.  Yeah I'm on to you Japan.  Sometimes I wonder if food hasn't evolved here because it's such a working culture.  There just isn't enough time in the day to sit down and eat, let alone think about something that you'd like to eat.  I see a lot of office workers (and my teammates) eating their meals out of the convenience store, and after work it's off to the izakaya to eat some meat on a stick and drink beer.  Then they go to bed, and repeat the next day.  So eating is more like something you have to do to keep working instead of something to enjoy.</p>

<p>I applaud the expatriates who choose to live here all year round.  You're a stronger person than I, because right now I'm counting down until I can go home.  Five more weeks baby!! </p>

<p><span style = "color:#48f">April 30 2014</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately I can't say that I will be able to take many things away from Japan in terms of softball skills, but playing here has taught me many life skills that I will have forever.  For example, </p>

<ul>
<li>Counting things - balls, reps, sprints, minutes in the day</li>
<li>Painstaking punctuality </li>
<li>Cleaning skills </li>
<li>Organizational skills </li>
<li>The ability to function with little to no coffee</li>
<li>The ability to function with little to no food</li>
<li>Portion control</li>
<li>Reduce Reuse Recycle
<li>Creating good conversations with myself</li>
<li>Communication with gestures</li> 
<li>Patience - or maybe impatience :(  </li> 
<li>Eating without making a mess of myself - napkins are hard to come by</li>
<li>Peeing in squat toilets</li>
<li>Being mindful of spending - this is a cash culture!</li>
<li>The ability to decipher Asian accents in general</li>
<li>The general appreciation for my own country</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list is by no means complete.  Living in a foreign country is definitely an experience I recommend, even for as little as a month.  While I lived in Vegas for a month I learned how to make food that is edible so I wouldn't starve.  Count it!  Traveling is one thing, but living in a foreign country is another.  The Japan I saw in 2008 is much different than the one I see today, and the Canada I go home to is completely different (for the better) than the one I saw before.  So get out there and get lost in the world.  It's really big!  But if you can't for whatever reason, go find a beaver to hug, or maybe a bald eagle for you Americans out there. </p>

<p><span style = "color:#48f">April 22 2014</span></p>

<p>Could you imagine playing high school softball and having that be your only softball knowledge in your repertoire?  Never been to a hitting lesson, never been to a Jennie Finch softball camp.  The only way you know how to swing the bat or field a ground ball is by watching everyone else and trial by fire.  Trust me there are lots of chances for trial by fire here, so whatever way you decide to swing, good or bad, it's not to hard to perfect whatever that method may be.  There is minimal instruction, zero mentorship, no discussion/questions or any sort of "coaching" in the sense that we know in North America.  Everyone practices the same way, and in the end the best athletes rise to the top and become successful.</p>

<p>It's a strange concept, but one that I can sort of grasp based on the culture.  Japanese roots run much deeper than in America, so there was more time for traditions to be established.  Whereas the western world was built entirely on immigration, new discovery, and many different types of people trying to find their way in a new land.  So even though softball is just a silly game, I see this history reflected in the sports culture.  Because there is a "traditional" way to play Japanese softball, no one really thinks to change it or put their own mark on it.  There is less individualization, and less of a desire by the average person to be unique.  Therefore, players and/or coaches are not as likely to come up with innovative ideas and open up "Sally's Baseball and Softball Instruction," or travel the country on "Akita Sensei's Coaching Tour."  And when it comes down to it, Japan did win the last World Championship and Olympic gold medal, so one could argue the system is working just fine.</p>

<p>But what happens when you're the "Bad News Bears" type of team that isn't among the group of "Most Talented Athletes?"  And no matter how many hours of practice, the traditional way isn't producing wins.  I'm still trying to figure that out myself.  As a foreigner, I can only stand back and make observations, and from my short time here it seems like everyone is still searching for that magic switch to win.  Everyone wants to win of course, but without experience and high level training it's very hard to come up with solutions that can yield tangible results.  Kind of like looking for your keys and searching everywhere in the house, but somehow in the back of your mind you know you'll never find them because they're actually locked in the car.  I can only assume that's why teams choose to spend absurd amounts of money to bring foreign players in.  If I can't win with what I have, then maybe I can buy my way to a championship.  This is a valid argument, as three of the top four teams of last season all had foreign players.  But as I've learned, there is more to it than flying me in and letting me loose.  And although I don't exactly know what it is that makes it difficult for me to play here, I have to keep searching for those keys just like everyone else. Ganbatte Todachu.</p>

Ok this is may be one of the few times I actually talk about softball, but this is your one chance to see the Crocodiles in action.  This upcoming weekend is the opening round of the Japanese professional league, and all games will be streamed and archived at this link.  This link as well as detailed results can be found on the JSA website.</p>

</center>

<p>The opening weekend is a pretty big event, and it's what every team has been preparing for in the past six months.  There are twelve teams in the league and they all travel to Nagoya to play their opening game in the Nagoya Dome, home of the Nagoya Dragons professional baseball team.  There are six games over the weekend and the matchups are arranged based on the regular season rankings of the previous season.  Here are the rankings from the 2013 season as well as the schedule for the upcoming weekend.  All times listed in Japan standard time.</p>

</table>

<p>All games following the opening weekend are completed in "rounds."  Three groups of four teams travel to locations all throughout Japan to play two games a piece.  Always one game Saturday, one game Sunday, with the exception of one weekend due to the odd number of opponents.  It's a neat concept and one that definitely increases the exposure of the sport throughout the country.  The host cities do a great job of marketing the event which leads to big crowds with lots of youth teams.  However, due to the irregular nature of the host locations, which are often in remote areas, streaming and video are limited.</p>

<p>So join in on the fun while you can, and support us from afar as we kick off our season!  Yoroshiku onegaishimasu!</p>



<p><span style = "color:#48f">April 2 2014</span></p>

<p>Before moving to Japan I had several naive preconceptions of the country.  For example, I expected to see items such as teriyaki chicken, California rolls, samurai in the street, pokemon everywhere, vending machines that serve me lunch, Japadogs, and the list goes on.  Needless to say my idea of this country was slightly different than the actual Japan I know now.  There is no teriyaki sauce, California rolls are blasphemy, samurai are for movies, pokemon are hardly everywhere, vending machines are best for drinks and not lunch, and Japadogs were a stretch anyways.  But one of the things I was most looking forward to was the advanced and futuristic technology that I had seen on tv and other sources of media living in Canada and the United States.  Japan is considered one of the leading nations in technology R&D and innovation, and honestly I really thought Asimo was going to greet me at the airport.  I was very disappointed that he did not.</p>

<p>Instead I've come to learn that Japan is a country that is deeply rooted in tradition, and in many ways quite old fashioned.  This is a country that still uses fax machines, cash for everything, postal service, stamps instead of signatures, and bank books.  When was the last time you saw a bank book?  I think mine's in my time capsule.  If it ain't broke don't fix it I suppose.  But, I was determined to find myself some futuristic technology and I did.  Two words: Robot Restaurant.  I don't care if everyone in there was white and spoke English, and the show was like a burlesque show on steroids.  It was like Japan had stockpiled all the robots in the country and hid them underground in Shinjuku, waiting for happy people like myself willing to pay 50 USD to eat a cold bento box and watch them dance with scantily clad women.</p>

<p>Now it's not just tourists who go to this place, celebrities love robots too!  Ask Katy Perry, she appears to be quite happy posing for a picture here.</p>

<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rc99qVY.jpg?2" style= "width:30%"/></center>

<p>This show is incredible.  It has everything from Kung Fu Panda, kegs on legs, a robot boxing match, glow sticks, segways, rainbow afros, audience interaction, and Gangnam Style!  What more could one want?  In addition, part of the fun was to look across the stage to the audience expressions on the other side.  I have taken the liberty of reading these people's minds and sharing their thoughts with the rest of you.</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NnaswLh.jpg" style= "width:60%"/></center>

<p>So there you go, technology in Japan does exist.  You just have to go look for it, and I gave you a head start in finding the robots!  You're welcome, doitashimashite.</p>

<p><em>A Day In The Life of a Todachuo Freshman</em></p>
<p>6:45 am -  My alarm goes off.  I've already snoozed twice but I need to get out of bed.  I'm tired because I was up until 12:30 am watching the latest J Soul brothers music video on repeat.  They are just so dreamy!</p> 

<p>7:00 am - My breakfast consists of leftover Hamanasu rice from the night before.  Good thing rice is my favorite food!  I'm not much of a breakfast person, and besides I need to keep my girlish figure.  Our trainer wants our body fat percentage report tomorrow and I can't have it say that I gained any weight.  I run enough at practice as it is!</p>

<p>7:20 am - This is when I officially start work at the hospital.  I'm a receptionist at the walk in clinic.  Thursdays are always our busiest days because that's the day all the doctors are in the office.  KILL ME.  Basically I run around like a crazy person looking after people, digging up their files, checking them in, cashing them out.  And can you believe it?  Yesterday someone yelled at me for going too slow!  Ugh, I wish I didn't have to work here and could just play softball as my job.</p>

<p>1:00 pm - Hooray my first workday is finished!  My job at the hospital is done and now it's time to run home, change, and ride my bike to the bus stop for practice.  I really need to hurry because the youngest players have to load the bus with all the equipment before we depart at 1:30 pm.</p>

<p>1:26 pm - We're driving to practice now.  We always leave before 1:30 pm as Japanese always act early!  It's now my lunch time and today it's pork katsu with some eggplant and okra in the bento today.  Yum!  I finish it all, even when I don't like what's for lunch because otherwise the other players look down on me for not finishing.  The Hamanasu bentos are a gift from the hospital and I need to show my appreciation by finishing every last bite.</p>

<p>2:15 pm - We're at the practice field, and the race is on!  It's a mad dash to unload the bus, make sure we have everything and scurry to the field as fast as possible.  We can't look like we're slacking off by walking.  I'm new, I can't let my rep be tarnished already.</p>

<p>2:30 pm - We've just had our pre-practice meeting, and it's time to warm up.  Our warm up lasts about 45 min but I really like it because I think it gets me in the zone to put my best effort into practice that day.  Too bad that eggplant at lunch is making my stomach rumble...Must fight this feeling.</p>

<p>7:00 pm - Practice is finished!  We've raked the field, cooled down, stretched, rolled the fence up and it's time to go home.  I'm pretty tired and I'm going to try and sleep on the bus ride home.  I still have to lift weights later.</p>

<p>8:00 pm - We're at Hamanasu eating dinner.  Today it's hamburg and rice, two of my favorite things!  If an older player doesn't want to eat their food, one of us first year players have to eat it for them.  We must eat every bite!  But, because today is hamburg day I will gladly eat any food leftover.</p>

<p>8:30 pm - We're back at the bus stop cleaning equipment.  This part of the day is always a downer because it takes so long.  As a first year, we have to clean the catcher's equipment, sheetos, tees and squeeze bottles.  We have so much equipment, and we have to make sure everything is accounted for and spotless.  If we do a bad job we could get in big trouble!  The older players only have to clean the balls so they're out of here in 20 min.  It takes us babies a whole hour to clean!  I can't wait until I'm old.</p>  

<p>9:30 pm - It's time to go work out.  Our workouts aren't too difficult but I'm pretty tired at this point in the day.  That and our trainer is there to watch us, and he keeps yelling at us to jump higher, push harder, move faster.  I'm trying my best but I don't think I will ever please him.</p>

<p>11:00 pm - I'm finally back home and I'm spent.  All in a day's work, and I can't wait to wake up tomorrow and do it all over again!  But first, I need to watch that J Soul Brothers video one more time..</p>

<p>This is Hamanasu, the hospital restaurant.  Fancy isn't it?  This is where employees can go for lunch and order standard Japanese fare ie. curry rice, ramen, udon, tempura don at a reasonable price.  The restaurant is only open for lunch time, BUT as a Todachuo softball player, Hamanasu makes bentos for the bus ride to practice.  Here are some lovely examples!</p>

<p>Then after practice, the team goes to Hamanasu to eat dinner.  Unfortunately the restaurant closes at 2pm which is when our dinner is prepared.  Our practice ends at 7pm, so our dinner waits in anticipation of our arrival.  Therefore, one could imagine the mean temperature of the food when we get there!  I often forget my thermometer but I would guess the temp ranges from 15-20 degrees Celsius or 59-68 degrees Fahrenheit for my American friends.  I love cold eggs, noodles and fish!</p>

<p>Ok I really don't like those things at all.  That's why whenever I eat there I try and eat everything as fast as possible without chewing.  Can't taste it that way and I'm starving by this point in the day so it's probably for the best.  However, after one complete season of eating at Hamanasu, I am FREE!!  I proclaim March 17 to be the last EVER Hamanasu meal for a foreign Todachuo player.  Many people celebrate St Patrick's Day on March 17, but in Japan a far more important celebration is at hand - No more cold dinners!  Feel free to celebrate worldwide with champagne, balloons, streamers, party hats, or cake.  Thank you, that is all.</p>

    <p>After living here for 9+ months, I have gotten to reflect on this country quite a bit.  Here are some observations I have made. </p>
    <ul>
    	<li>The ideal height for a girl is 5'4" and your shoe size should not exceed a 9 lest you be limited to men's shoes forever.</li>  
		<li>No high heels are too high.</li>
		<li>Platform shoes are still in style.</li>
		<li>Watch your weight, or get a higher metabolism.  Clothing does not go above a size 6.</li>
		<li>Japan is probably the most anti-vegetarian country EVER.</li>
		<li>Heated toilet seats are common, and welcome by all.</li>
 		<li>No establishment is complete without a sink to wash your hands.</li>
		<li>Garbage cans are uneccessary eyesores.</li>
		<li>It's either baseball season or it's not.</li>
		<li>No outfit is complete without a fanny pack.</li>
		<li>Service is ALWAYS with a smile.</li>
		<li>Men should not have facial hair, as you give the impression of being homeless.</li>
		<li>No workday is too long.</li>
		<li>No picture is complete without a peace sign.</li>
		<li>If you look lost for long enough, someone will surely help you.</li>
		<li>Surgical masks are not just for surgery.</li>
		<li>Children should not cry.  It brings shame to the family.</li>  
    </ul>
