		<br />
		My name is You, pronounced "Yo." My favorite sushi is uni, and my favorite noodle is soba.  As the starting catcher it is my job to take care of the emotional pitchers we have, especially the ones that don't speak Japanese!  It's a pretty exhausting job, and I wish someone would consider my feelings too...

		My name is Watanabe and I'm the jokester on the team.  I really like to keep the mood light at practice because honestly, who likes practice anyways?  I was the "Homerun Queen" last year so basically I run this ship.  Another talent of mine is singing and dancing, and my favorite songs are "Candy Smile" and "Peanut Butter Jelly Time."

		My name is Akine.  I'm an infielde but one day Yamasaki-san thought I would be a good catcher.  Catching sure is hard stuff, so I have since retired from the position.  I don't speak very good English, but I'm trying my best to learn.  I am one third of the tripod that is Imari, Toufuku and myself.  A deadly combination indeed.

		My name is Imari, but you can call me Emily.  My favorite thing to do at softball is cheer for my teammates.  I'm the best cheerer, and the team loves it when I yell YA-TA and go around and give high fives!  I'm the second leg of the tripod and the shortest member.

I even broke my hand last year from swinging too much!  Unfortunately I broke my hand after Jen and Ohta's hands were healed, so I did not become a Hand Friend.

I'm from West Virginia, and my claim to fame is winning the "Little Miss West Virginia" beauty pagent.  My hometown has no electricity so I'm excited to use my first telephone and ride my first bullet train.

		Note:  This crocodile has yet to be seen by human eyes.

I support the Toda rugby team and go to all their events.  I speak the best english in the company because I've traveled all around the world, even to Vancouver!

		My name is Murata-sensei and I am the BIGGEST Todachuo softball fan there is.  I am at every game, and I often stop by at practice.  I'd really like to be coach if I could, as I think I'm very insightful about softball and life in general.  My biggest claim to fame is my epic post game speeches.  I've been clocked in at a full 20 minutes!  Don't even try to stop me!

		My name is Suzuki-san but you can call me "Lucky Position."  I am in charge of all softball operations for the team.  Usually I just take care of the logistical side, but I've really gotten involved in coaching lately.  You can think of me as the general manager of the team.  I always stand at the end of the dugout because I can yell at Yamasaki-san, while staying dry from the rain!

		You can call me "The Sushi Guy" because I love the stuff!  Whenever we have a special guest in town I suggest we go out for sushi!  I also bring candy and popsicles to practice sometimes. The team really likes those days because they get a break from practice to eat the popsicles.  I really spoil them, so I think I'm their favorite.

		My name is Yamasaki-san, but you can call me "Motorcycle."  I'm the head coach of the team and get to wear number 30.  I was a catcher for the Japanese national team, so I know a lot about softball.  I'm such a nice guy though, so I get the staff around me make all the decisions at game time.  My favorite thing to do at practice is hit knock, and talk on the phone.

		My name is Hattori-san, but you can call me "Coach."  Last year I was one of two athletic trainers, but this year I've been promoted to the primary trainer and assistant coach.  I run the practices and decide what drills the team does.  I get new ideas for drills all the time, and the best part of my day is watching the team do them improperly!

		My name is Hoshino-san, and I'm the bus driver.  You might not think that my job is very important but it is.  Todachuo uses the bus everyday for practice, and we drive to all of our games.  So when we have a weekend series in Nagasaki, I'm your guy!  Some of these trips require more than 12 hours of driving, so in this case I need another driver to take shifts.  It also helps to have someone to help me clean the bus, as it normally takes me two hours by myself!

<p class = "intro">Japanese is a hard language to learn.  Let's all learn together!  Here are some words, phrases and tips vital to survival on a Japanese softball team.</p>  


<ol style = "font-family: Bookman, serif; font-size: 1.1em">
	<li>Counting to 10.  Probably <strong>THE</strong> most important thing to know playing softball.  The Japanese love counting reps and timing drills! </li>
		<ul>
		<li>1 - ichi, 2 - ni, 3 - san, 4 - shi, 5 - go, 6 - roku, 7 - shichi, 8 - hachi, 9 - kyu, 10 - ju, 11 - ju ichi, 12 - ju ni etc etc</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Many Japanese words originate from English.  Sound more Japanese by saying words twice!  For example,</li>
		<ul>
		<li>yes yes</li>
		<li>no no</li>
		<li>many many</li>
		<li>ok ok</li>
		</ul>

	<li>Asking questions - The 5 W's.</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Who? - Dare?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Who is the head coach? = Kantoku wa <em>dare</em> desu ka?
			</ul>
		<li>What? - Nani/Nan?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>What is that?  <em>Nan</em> desu ka?
			</ul>
		<li>When? - Itsu?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>When do you go?  <em>Itsu</em> ikimasu ka?
			</ul>
		<li>Where? - Doko?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Where is my riceball?  Watashi no onigiri wa <em>doko</em> desu ka?
			</ul>
		<li>Why? - Naze?</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Why running?  <em>Naze</em> ranningu?
			</ul>	
		</ul>
	<li>Daijobu desu = I'm ok.  Very useful phrase to get out of extra practice, running, or even strange foods!</li>
	<li>Complements are easy because any good deed or job well done can be acknowledged with "Nice."  For example, "Nice batting," "Nice pitching," "Nice eating," "Nice English."</li>

	
</ol>


<p class = "intro">Now for some vocabulary.  Probably the hardest part about communicating in Japan is the inability to come up with the words to express what you want or are looking for.  Hover the curser over the picture to learn the words.  All Japanese words are written in Romaji, or the "English" form of the word.  Here are some rules of thumb for pronounciation.</p>

<div id = "pronounciation">
<ul style = "font-family: Bookman, serif; font-size: 1.1em">
<li>Vowel sounds
	<ul>
	<li>A = ah, as in hah or law </li>
	<li>I = ee, as in free or machine  </li>
	<li>U = oo, as in boo or moo  </li>
	<li>E = eh, as in met </li>
	<li>O = oh, as in so or mow </li>
	</ul>
<li>There are no L or V sounds, where L sounds like R, and V sounds like B. </li>
<li>R sounds like a mix between R and L, and sort of like D.  R in Japanese sounds similar to R in Spanish</li>
<li>Double consonants means you pronounce it twice.  Ex. Bookkepper. </li> 
</ul>

    <p>After living here for 9+ months, I have gotten to reflect on this country quite a bit.  Here are some observations I have made. </p>
    <ul>
    	<li>The ideal height for a girl is 5'4" and your shoe size should not exceed a 9 lest you be limited to men's shoes forever.</li>  
		<li>No high heels are too high.</li>
		<li>Platform shoes are still in style.</li>
		<li>Watch your weight, or get a higher metabolism.  Clothing does not go above a size 6.</li>
		<li>Japan is probably the most anti-vegetarian country EVER.</li>
		<li>Heated toilet seats are common, and welcome by all.</li>
 		<li>No establishment is complete without a sink to wash your hands.</li>
		<li>Garbage cans are uneccessary eyesores.</li>
		<li>It's either baseball season or it's not.</li>
		<li>No outfit is complete without a fanny pack.</li>
		<li>Service is ALWAYS with a smile.</li>
		<li>Men should not have facial hair, as you give the impression of being homeless.</li>
		<li>No workday is too long.</li>
		<li>No picture is complete without a peace sign.</li>
		<li>If you look lost for long enough, someone will surely help you.</li>
		<li>Surgical masks are not just for surgery.</li>
		<li>Children should not cry.  It brings shame to the family.</li>
