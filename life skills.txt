Unfortunately I can't say that I will be able to take many things away from Japan in terms of softball skills, but playing here has taught me many life skills that I will have forever.  For example, 

Counting things - balls, reps, sprints, minutes in the day
Painstaking punctuality 
Cleaning skills 
Organizational skills
The ability to function with little to no coffee
The ability to function with little to no food
Recycling 
Creating good conversations with myself
Communication with gestures 
Patience - Or maybe impatience :(
Eating without making a mess of myself - napkins are hard to come by
Being mindful of spending - this is a cash culture!
The ability to decipher Asian accents in general
The general appreciation for my own country

And the list is by no means complete.  Living in a foreign country is definitely an experience I recommend, even for as little as a month.  While I lived in Vegas for a month I learned how to make food that is edible so I wouldn't starve.  Count it!  Traveling is one thing, but living in a foreign country is another.  The Japan I saw in 2008 is much different than the one I see today, and the Canada I go home to is completely different (for the better) than the one I saw before.  So get out there and get lost in the world.  It's really big!  But if you can't for whatever reason, go find a beaver to hug, or maybe a bald eagle for you Americans out there.
