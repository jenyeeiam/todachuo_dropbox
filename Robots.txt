Before moving to Japan I had several naive preconceptions of the country.  For example, I expected to see items such as teriyaki chicken, California rolls, samurai in the street, pokemon everywhere, vending machines that serve me lunch, Japadogs, and the list goes on.  Needless to say my idea of this country was slightly different than the actual Japan I know now.  There is no teriyaki sauce, California rolls are blasphemy, samurai are for movies, pokemon are hardly everywhere, vending machines are best for drinks and not lunch, and Japadogs were a stretch anyways.  But one of the things I was most looking forward to was the advanced and futuristic technology that I had seen on tv and other sources of media living in Canada and America.  Japan is considered one of the leading nations in technology R&D and innovation, and honestly I really thought Asimo was going to greet me at the airport.  I was very disappointed that he did not.

Instead I've come to learn that Japan is a country that is deeply rooted in tradition, and in many ways quite old fashioned.  This is a country that still uses fax machines, cash for everything, postal service, stamps instead of signatures, and bank books.  When was the last time you saw a bank book?  I think mine's in my time capsule.  If it ain't broke don't fix it I suppose.  But, I was determined to find myself some futuristic technology and I did.  Two words: Robot Restaurant.  I don't care if everyone in there was white and spoke English, and the show was like a burlesque show on steroids, it was like Japan had stockpiled all the robots in the country and hid them underground in Shinjuku.  Waiting for happy people like myself willing to pay 50 USD to eat a cold bento box and see robots.

Now it's not just tourists who go to this place, celebrities love robots too!  Ask Katy Perry, she appears to be quite happy posing for a picture here.

This show is incredible.  It has everything from Kung Fu Panda, kegs on legs, a robot boxing match, glow sticks, segways, rainbow afros, audience interaction, and Gangnam Style!  What more could one want?  In addition, part of the fun was to look across the stage to the audience expressions on the other side.  I have taken the liberty of reading these people's minds and to share with the rest of you.

So there you go, technology in Japan does exist.  You just have to search it out, and I gave you a head start in finding the robots!  You're welcome, doitashimashite.
